    "Context-free grammars arise in linguistics where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were in fact invented by the linguist Noam Chomsky for this purpose. By contrast, in computer science, as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) called the Document Type Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages generated by context-free grammars are known as context-free languages (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The language equality question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is undecidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context-free grammars are used in compilers and in particular for parsing, taking a string-based program and figuring out what it means. Typically, CFGs are used to define the high-level structure of a programming language. Figuring out how a particular string was derived tells us about its structure and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, some authors use the term phrase structure grammar to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from dependency grammars. In computer science, a popular notation for context-free grammars is Backus–Naur form, or BNF.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context-free grammar (CFG) consists of a finite set of grammar rules is a quadruple (N, T, P, S) where\n",
    "\n",
    "N is a set of non-terminal symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "T is a set of terminals where N ∩ T = NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "P is a set of rules, P: N → (N ∪ T)*, i.e., the left-hand side of the production rule P does have any right context or left context.\n",
    "\n",
    "S is the start symbol.\n",

    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar ({A}, {a, b, c}, P, A), P : A → aA, A → abc.\n",
    "The grammar ({S, a, b}, {a, b}, P, S), P: S → aSa, S → bSb, S → ε\n",
    "The grammar ({S, F}, {0, 1}, P, S), P: S → 00S | 11F, F → 00F | ε\n",
