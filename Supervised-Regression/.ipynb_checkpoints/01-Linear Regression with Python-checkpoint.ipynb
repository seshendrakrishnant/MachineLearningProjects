    "Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.\n",

    "She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!\n",

    "* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.\n",

    "## Regression Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Error** (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i-\\hat{y}_i|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error** (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Mean Squared Error** (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\frac 1n\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE** is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.\n",
    "- **MSE** is more popular than MAE, because MSE \"punishes\" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.\n",
    "- **RMSE** is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the \"y\" units.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are **loss functions**, because we want to minimize them."
